Dev 10 assessment on pandas and visualizations

Every year The United States Census Bureau conducts their [Annual Business Survey (ABS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/abs/about.html) electronically. It provides information on selected economic and demographic characteristics for businesses and business owners by sex, ethnicity, race, and veteran status.

In this project, we use the ABS to learn more about demographics in The United States' businesses. In this repo you will find our project in its entirety.

If you would like to view our process for Extracting, Transforming, and Loading the data, see `ETL.ipynb`.
If you would like to see how the visualizations were created, see `visualizations.ipynb`.
The report can be found in `ABS_Report.pdf`.
